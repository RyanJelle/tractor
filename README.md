OSX Trac UI
===========

The trac bug tracking system is slow when doing bulk operations. This is a UI, modeled after the 
the "Things" todo application, allows for easy sorting and editing of tickets.

Note: Development work discontinued because the Trac XML api is not supported in current releases
of track.
